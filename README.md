## Tasks

### Backend

1. Creating content for front-e the CMS server has pre-defined types and component: `HomePage`. Your first task is to build the content for the homepage so that the frontend can consume it and will be able to render the content on the front-end. It should consist of the following:

- 2 Two-Column Blocks and 1 Header.

### Front-end

1. In the front-end server, Fill-in the needed fields in the query on `homepage.graphql` query under `graphl/queries/cms`. Run `yarn gen` to update the genrated file.
2. Complete components for `TwoColumnBlock` and `HeaderBlock` so that the front-end can properly render them. If you can also complete `CarouselBlock`, that would be much better. You may use `HomePageSectionsComponent` to select the components based on their typename, but its not necessary.
3. After completing the the components create a pull-request of your fork, to the main repo and send us a message upon completion.
